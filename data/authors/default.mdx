## About Me

Hello, I’m Micah - an explorer at the intersection of technology and personal freedom.

### My Journey

My professional journey began with aspirations of breaking into Silicon Valley, however, I quickly realized the intense competition and the relentless pace at which everyone operated. Feeling outpaced and undervalued, I redirected my path towards a smaller software company in Syracuse, where my contributions led to an acquisition by a larger entity. But as corporate life demanded more and withdrew flexibility, I found myself working 12-hour days, exhausting myself to stay relevant in a greedy corperation.

I was serving a corporate giant that undervalued my well-being and stifled my creative potential. It was a world where my boss flourished with extravagant possessions while I merely helped pay the bills. This realization ignited a transformative decision—I decided to quit during a period of massive layoffs in the tech industry. I chose to invest in myself.

### My Mission

I vowed to reshape my professional life around my passions and values. I believe in a work-life balance, in doing projects that ignite my interest, and in living a life where I am not just another cog in the machine. My mission is to build a business that reflects my identity.

### What I Do

I document my journey not to chase fame, but to inspire others to pursue their own paths authentically. Through videos, photos, and stories, I share not just what I do, but who I am. Everyone has a story worth telling — mine is about finding freedom in freelance, embracing life’s simplicities, and inspiring others.

I am committed to educating and sharing knowledge online, believing that everyone can contribute meaningfully to a larger conversation. I'm here to prove that you don’t need to be famous to impact the world; you just need to be real.

### Join Me

If my journey resonates with you, or if you’re curious about creating a more meaningful digital footprint, join me. Together, we can build not just a platform, but a community where everyone is free to be themselves and proud of their digital space.

Let’s make the internet what it should have been — a place of genuine connection and self-expression.
